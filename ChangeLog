Release 1.17 (2019-10-22): At the request of Jeroen Ooms, added
some files to better support operation of the ncdf4 package 
in Windows.

Release 1.0 (2010-02-23): Initial release of the ncdf4 package,
which provides a high-level R interface to the
netcdf library, versions 4 and earlier.  Package ncdf4 REPLACES package ncdf, which
supplied an interface to version 3 of the netcdf library.
Due to changing coding standards requested by CRAN over
the years, the NAMES of the functions in ncdf4 are different than the
names in ncdf.  For example, the function that used to be 
called "dim.def.ncdf" in ncdf is now called "ncdim_def" in ncdf4.
